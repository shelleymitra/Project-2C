# Project-2C
This is the github page for project 2c. here, I will be analyzing the structures of VEGF and TSP to see if there are any similarities in their binding domains.
The scientific queation is: Angiogenesis refers to the formation of blood vessels that promotes cancerous cell growth and migration. While VEGF promotes angiogenesis, thrombospondin can prevent it via its heparin-binding site. Does VEGF exhibit similar nucleotide sequences and protein structures to thrombospondinâ€™s heparin-binding domain, given that these proteins work on the same biological mechanism?

The hypothesis is: If thrombospondin exhibits its anti-angiogenic effects via its heparin-binding domain, then VEGF will have similar nucleotide sequences and protein structures when compared to this domain because these two proteins exert opposite effects on angiogenesis.



Three PDB files were uploaded: vegfhuman.pdb, tspc.pdb, and tsp_1_2.pdb. These PDB files were used for 3D structural measurements and RMSDs and PCAs.
veg.human.pdb is a pdb file of the vegf protein found in humans. This promotes angiogenesis.
tspc.dpb is a pdb file of the c-domain of the thrombospondin protein. The C-domain was focused on because this is thought to be where thrombospondin exerts its anti-angiogenic effects.
tsp_1_2.pdb is a pdb file of domains 1 and 2 of the thrombospondin. I just wanted to use this in a pairwise alignment to see if I got better results but I will likely remove this for the final project.

Three fasta files were uploaded: vegf_fasta, tsp_fasta, vegft212_fasta. These fastas were used for the pairwise sequence alignment and multiple sequence alignment.
Vegf_fasta is a fasta file representing the vegf gene, which is responsible for promoting angiogenesis.
tsp_fasta is a fasta file that represents the full TSP gene, which is responsible for preventing angiogenedid/
vegft212_fasta is a fasta file on the t212 domain. Once again, I just downloaded this so I could try out a multiple sequence alignment but I don't think I will keep this in the final project because the MSA did not really give me any information.
